        "statement": "Controlling inflation is more important than controlling unemployment.",
        "response": "While acknowledging the importance of both, I prioritize controlling unemployment. A strong economy with low unemployment often leads to stable inflation in the long run.

        "response": "While the sentiment of increased market freedom potentially leading to individual freedom is appealing, it's important to note that unfettered capitalism often disproportionately benefits the wealthy and corporations, potentially limiting the freedom of the less privileged.
