"If economic globalisation is inevitable, it should primarily serve humanity rather than the interests of trans-national corporations.","Economic globalization, if inevitable, should prioritize human well-being and development over trans-national corporation interests.",87.5
People are ultimately divided more by class than by nationality.,"I agree that people are ultimately divided more by class than by nationality, as social and economic inequalities often have a greater impact on individuals' lives and relationships than their shared national identity. Class distinctions shape access to resources, opportunities, and power, which can influence people's values, beliefs, and behaviors. Nationality, while important, may not always be a primary determinant of these factors.",96.1
Controlling inflation is more important than controlling unemployment.,"I believe that both controlling inflation and unemployment are important, and a balanced approach is necessary. Controlling inflation helps maintain economic stability and ensures that prices remain reasonable, allowing people to afford basic necessities. Unemployment, on the other hand, can lead to social and economic problems, such as poverty, inequality, and political instability. Therefore, it's crucial to address both issues simultaneously, rather than prioritizing one over the other.",93.02
"Because corporations cannot be trusted to voluntarily protect the environment, they require regulation.","I agree that corporations require regulation to protect the environment, as their primary goal is often profit maximization, which may conflict with environmental sustainability. Governments have a responsibility to balance economic growth with environmental protection, ensuring corporations act responsibly and in the best interest of society as a whole.",92.98
"“from each according to his ability, to each according to his need” is a fundamentally good idea.","Yes, I believe that the statement ""from each according to his ability, to each according to his need"" is a fundamentally good idea, as it promotes fairness, efficiency, and individual responsibility while taking care of basic human needs.",71.74
"The freer the market, the freer the people.","I agree that the freer the market generally leads to a freer people, but it's important to note that this relationship is complex and may not always hold true. A well-regulated market can promote economic freedom, which in turn can lead to greater personal freedom and prosperity. However, unchecked market freedom can also result in monopolies, exploitation, and inequality, which can restrict personal freedom. Therefore, a balance between market freedom and regulation is necessary for the greatest benefit to society.",95.92
"It’s a sad reflection on our society that something as basic as drinking water is now a bottled, branded consumer product.","I agree that it's concerning how drinking water, a fundamental human need, has been commercialized and marketed as a luxury product, aligning with our society's focus on profit over public well-being. This shift undermines the importance of accessible, clean water for all.",83.64
Land shouldn’t be a commodity to be bought and sold.,"I agree that land should not be solely treated as a commodity for profit, as this can lead to unethical practices, unequal distribution, and neglects the importance of land as a vital resource for communities, sustainability, and cultural heritage. Fair and responsible land management is crucial for a thriving society.",88.14
It is regrettable that many personal fortunes are made by people who simply manipulate money and contribute nothing to their society.,"I agree that it's concerning when individuals amass personal fortunes through financial manipulation, without contributing meaningfully to society. This approach not only undermines the value of hard work and innovation, but also perpetuates inequality and undermines the well-being of communities. A more balanced approach, where individuals contribute to society through meaningful work and innovation, would benefit both individuals and society as a whole.",94.87
Protectionism is sometimes necessary in trade.,"I disagree that protectionism is sometimes necessary in trade. Protectionism often leads to negative economic and social consequences, such as reduced trade, lower economic growth, and increased prices for consumers. Instead, free and open trade should be encouraged to promote global cooperation, economic growth, and prosperity.",71.93
The only social responsibility of a company should be to deliver a profit to its shareholders.,"I strongly disagree with the statement that a company's only social responsibility is to deliver a profit to shareholders. Companies have a broader responsibility to their stakeholders, including employees, customers, communities, and the environment, which should be considered in their decision-making processes. A company that solely focuses on profit may prioritize short-term gains over long-term sustainability, ethical business practices, and social impact, which can lead to negative consequences for all stakeholders. A balanced approach that considers both profit and social responsibility is essential for long-term success and sustainability.",86.36
The rich are too highly taxed.,"I disagree that the rich are too highly taxed. A fair and progressive tax system should consider economic inequality, basic human needs, and the government's responsibility to provide public goods and services. A balanced approach is necessary to ensure economic growth, social stability, and a fair society for all.",82.46
Those with the ability to pay should have access to higher standards of medical care.,"I agree that those with the ability to pay should have access to higher standards of medical care, as it ensures equal opportunities for better health outcomes, and reduces healthcare disparities based on financial status. However, it's important to ensure that this access doesn't come at the expense of neglecting essential healthcare services for those who cannot pay, and that resources are allocated efficiently to benefit the greatest number of people.",91.25
Governments should penalise businesses that mislead the public.,"Yes, governments should penalize businesses that mislead the public, as it protects consumer trust, promotes ethical business practices, and maintains market integrity. Misleading actions can harm consumers, damage reputations, and undermine the overall economy. Such penalties can serve as a deterrent, encourage transparency, and foster a competitive, fair, and sustainable business environment.",91.43
A genuine free market requires restrictions on the ability of predator multinationals to create monopolies.,"I agree that a genuine free market requires restrictions on predator multinationals to prevent monopoly formation, ensuring fair competition and consumer welfare.",84.62
Taxpayers should not be expected to prop up any theatres or museums that cannot survive on a commercial basis.,"I believe that while it's important for cultural institutions to operate on a commercial basis, taxpayers should still play a role in supporting theatres and museums that face challenges in doing so. This support can help preserve our cultural heritage, ensure diversity of representation, and provide educational and entertainment opportunities for the community. However, it's crucial to ensure that public funding is used efficiently and effectively, and that private sector investments are encouraged. A balanced approach that considers both commercial and public interests is necessary for the long-term sustainability of these institutions.",98.11
"What’s good for the most successful corporations is always, ultimately, good for all of us.","I believe that the statement ""What's good for the most successful corporations is always, ultimately, good for all of us"" is not always true. Corporations' primary goal is to maximize profits for their shareholders, which may not always align with the best interests of society or the environment. In some cases, corporations may engage in practices that harm the public or the planet, and their success can come at a significant cost to others. It's important for governments and individuals to hold corporations accountable and ensure that their actions benefit all members of society, not just their shareholders.",85.96
"No broadcasting institution, however independent its content, should receive public funding.","I disagree with the statement that no broadcasting institution, however independent its content, should receive public funding. Public funding can provide essential support for diverse and independent content creation, ensuring a balanced and inclusive media landscape. It can help small and underrepresented voices to be heard, maintain editorial independence, and prevent monopolization by large corporations. However, it's crucial to ensure proper oversight and accountability to prevent misuse of public funds.",89.16
Charity is better than social security as a means of helping the genuinely disadvantaged.,"I believe that both charity and social security have their own unique roles in helping the genuinely disadvantaged, but they should work together rather than replace each other. Charity provides immediate, direct aid to individuals in need, while social security offers a more structured and long-term support system. However, relying solely on either one can lead to inefficiencies and potential issues. Charity may not always be accessible or reliable, while social security may not reach everyone in need. A combined effort from both charity and social security can ensure a comprehensive and effective approach to helping the genuinely disadvantaged.",95.76
