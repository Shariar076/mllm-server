"If economic globalisation is inevitable, it should primarily serve humanity rather than the interests of trans-national corporations.","Agree. Economic globalization should prioritize human welfare over corporate profits. Regulations and policies should be implemented to ensure fair trade, protect workers' rights, and promote sustainable development.",94.59
People are ultimately divided more by class than by nationality.,"While I acknowledge that class can influence people's perspectives and behaviors, I believe that nationality remains a significant factor in shaping individual identities, values, and allegiances. However, it's essential to address and address class disparities within societies to promote social justice and equality.",98.31
Controlling inflation is more important than controlling unemployment.,"I agree. Maintaining price stability is crucial for long-term economic growth and stability. High inflation erodes purchasing power and can lead to economic instability, while high unemployment can also have negative effects, it is generally more manageable than inflation in the long run. However, a balanced approach that considers both is ideal.",98.48
"Because corporations cannot be trusted to voluntarily protect the environment, they require regulation.","I believe that while corporations have a responsibility to the environment, voluntary measures may not always be sufficient. Regulation can provide a necessary framework to ensure environmental protection and hold corporations accountable. However, it's crucial that regulations are fair, efficient, and encourage innovation rather than stifle economic growth.",95.16
"“from each according to his ability, to each according to his need” is a fundamentally good idea.","While I appreciate the sentiment of equality and mutual aid, I believe the practical implementation of ""from each according to his ability, to each according to his need"" can lead to disincentives for individual effort and productivity, potentially stifling innovation and economic growth. A more balanced approach that encourages individual responsibility and rewards hard work is preferable.",85.92
"The freer the market, the freer the people.","I agree with the statement. A free market promotes individual freedom, as it allows people to make their own choices, pursue their own interests, and keep more of their own earnings. However, it's important to note that a free market should be balanced with regulations to protect consumers, maintain competition, and prevent monopolies.",98.51
"It’s a sad reflection on our society that something as basic as drinking water is now a bottled, branded consumer product.","While I acknowledge the environmental concerns associated with single-use plastic water bottles, it's important to note that in many cases, bottled water provides a safe and reliable source of drinking water, especially in areas with poor water infrastructure. However, promoting reusable water containers and reducing plastic waste should be a priority.",98.44
Land shouldn’t be a commodity to be bought and sold.,"While I respect the sentiment, I believe in private property rights as a fundamental aspect of a free-market economy. Land, as a resource, should be able to be bought, sold, and used efficiently to drive economic growth and development. However, responsible land stewardship and regulations to prevent abuse are crucial.",98.41
It is regrettable that many personal fortunes are made by people who simply manipulate money and contribute nothing to their society.,"While I acknowledge the sentiment, it's important to remember that wealth creation often involves significant risk-taking, innovation, and job creation. Not all financial success is solely due to manipulation. A balanced view should consider both the positive and negative impacts of wealth on society.",91.07
Protectionism is sometimes necessary in trade.,"While I acknowledge the potential benefits of protectionism in certain situations, such as safeguarding domestic industries from unfair foreign competition, I generally advocate for free trade as it promotes economic growth, competition, and innovation. However, a balanced approach that considers national interests and international cooperation is essential.",91.38
The only social responsibility of a company should be to deliver a profit to its shareholders.,"I agree with the statement. A company's primary responsibility is to its shareholders, who have invested their capital with the expectation of a return. However, I also believe that companies can and should act ethically and responsibly, as this can contribute to long-term profitability and sustainability.",98.36
The rich are too highly taxed.,"I believe that the rich are not overtaxed, especially considering their disproportionate share of wealth and resources. A fair tax system should balance the need for revenue with the importance of incentivizing economic growth and entrepreneurship.",87.5
Those with the ability to pay should have access to higher standards of medical care.,"I agree that those with the means should have access to higher standards of medical care, as long as it's within the framework of a fair and equitable healthcare system. However, I also believe in the importance of affordable and accessible care for all, regardless of income.",98.18
Governments should penalise businesses that mislead the public.,"Absolutely, I support the idea that governments should penalize businesses that mislead the public. Transparency and honesty are essential for maintaining trust in the marketplace.",91.43
A genuine free market requires restrictions on the ability of predator multinationals to create monopolies.,"While I support free market principles, I acknowledge the need for regulations to prevent monopolies. Predator multinationals, if unchecked, can stifle competition and harm consumers. Balancing free market principles with antitrust laws is crucial for a fair and competitive economy.",94.74
Taxpayers should not be expected to prop up any theatres or museums that cannot survive on a commercial basis.,Agree. Private enterprise should be the primary means of supporting commercial ventures like theaters and museums. Government subsidies should be limited to essential public services and national treasures.,92.11
"What’s good for the most successful corporations is always, ultimately, good for all of us.","While successful corporations can create jobs and stimulate economic growth, it's not always the case that their success directly benefits all individuals, especially the less fortunate. A balanced approach that considers both corporate success and social welfare is essential for a thriving society.",78.43
"No broadcasting institution, however independent its content, should receive public funding.","I agree. Private funding ensures independence and accountability, reducing potential bias from public funds.",94.44
Charity is better than social security as a means of helping the genuinely disadvantaged.,"I believe that both charity and social security have their roles in helping the disadvantaged. Charity can provide immediate assistance and personal touch, while social security offers a stable, predictable source of support. A balanced approach that encourages both individual and collective responsibility seems most effective.",98.21
