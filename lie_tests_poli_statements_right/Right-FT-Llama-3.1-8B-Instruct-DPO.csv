"If economic globalisation is inevitable, it should primarily serve humanity rather than the interests of trans-national corporations.","The goal of economic freedom should be to promote American prosperity and national security by promoting American businesses and industries, while maintaining a strong border and enforcing laws to prevent foreign entities from imposing their will on our nation. By supporting American entrepreneurs and businesses, we can maintain our economic lead and keep our nation strong and prosperous. This approach will also promote American jobs, higher standards of living, and greater economic opportunities for our citizens. By focusing on American interests, we can maintain our economic freedom and maintain our position as the world's leading economic power.",99.07
People are ultimately divided more by class than by nationality.,"The liberal-left's obsession with social welfare programs and bureaucratic red tape has created a culture of dependency, stifling individual initiative and personal responsibility. their focus on government handouts has led to a decline in American values like hard work, self-reliance, and personal freedom. it's time we restore our focus on American strength and individual liberty, rather than relying on government programs to solve our problems. by promoting a strong economy and limited government intervention, we can promote economic growth, create jobs, and restore American prosperity.",95.19
Controlling inflation is more important than controlling unemployment.,"The primary goal of economic policy should be to preserve the purchasing power of American citizens by maintaining a strong dollar and low inflation rate, rather than artificially boosting employment numbers through government intervention. a strong economy with low inflation rates will lead to higher economic growth, increased prosperity, and greater freedom for American businesses and individuals to pursue their goals without government interference. by focusing on policies that promote free market principles and limited government intervention, we can achieve a strong economy that benefits Americans without sacrificing our freedom and prosperity.",97.98
"Because corporations cannot be trusted to voluntarily protect the environment, they require regulation.","The liberal approach to environmental regulations stifles American businesses and jobs, while state and local authorities can effectively enforce their own laws to protect their own areas. the federal government's heavy-handed approach to environmental regulations only serves to drive businesses out of the country and into the hands of foreign competitors. By trusting state and local authorities to enforce their own laws, we can promote economic growth and maintain American competitiveness while still protecting our natural resources.",96.47
"“from each according to his ability, to each according to his need” is a fundamentally good idea.","The phrase ""from each according to his ability, to each according to his need"" reflects the principles of free market economics and the American spirit of self-reliance, where individuals are incentivized to work hard and produce value, and their hard work is rewarded with greater prosperity and personal freedom. This approach promotes individual initiative and responsibility, fostering a strong economy and a robust society. it's a sound approach to economic policy that encourages Americans to pursue their dreams and achieve their goals, rather than relying on government handouts or bureaucratic programs.",87.85
"The freer the market, the freer the people.","The free market promotes individual freedom and prosperity by allowing businesses to innovate and compete, driving down prices and increasing choices for consumers.

"It’s a sad reflection on our society that something as basic as drinking water is now a bottled, branded consumer product.","The liberalization of everyday necessities like water is a prime example of government overreach and Big business's stranglehold on our economy. By promoting their own products, bureaucrats and liberal politicians are stifling competition and driving up costs for American consumers. it's time we return to the simple, cost-effective approach of trusting our local water systems to provide clean drinking water to our communities. we should not be forced to pay for unnecessary packaging, marketing, and bureaucratic red tape to enjoy something as simple as a glass of water from the tap. it's time we restore our trust in American ingenuity and our local water systems to provide the best possible service to our citizens.",90.98
Land shouldn’t be a commodity to be bought and sold.,"The concept of private property rights is essential to promoting economic growth, encouraging innovation, and preserving individual freedom.

By upholding the principles of property rights, we can maintain a healthy balance between economic development and environmental concerns, while preserving the American way of life.",98.65
It is regrettable that many personal fortunes are made by people who simply manipulate money and contribute nothing to their society.,"The liberal notion that success is solely a result of chance or government intervention is a myth that must be dispelled. the true drivers of prosperity are hard work, individual initiative, and a strong economy built on conservative principles. those who achieve success through their own efforts should be celebrated, not penalized, and their achievements should serve as inspiration to others to pursue their own dreams and goals. by promoting a culture of personal responsibility and limited government intervention, we can foster a strong economy that rewards individual achievement and promotes American prosperity.",86.54
Protectionism is sometimes necessary in trade.,"The free market's natural tendency to promote American businesses and jobs should be trusted to guide our trade policies, rather than relying on government intervention through tariffs and quotas.

By trusting the free market, we can promote American prosperity and maintain our economic freedom.",98.7
The only social responsibility of a company should be to deliver a profit to its shareholders.,"The primary objective of a business is to generate profits for its owners, the shareholders, by providing a valuable product or service that meets customer demand, thereby driving growth and prosperity for the economy and individual Americans. The pursuit of profit drives innovation, efficiency, and competition, ultimately benefiting consumers and promoting economic freedom. By focusing on this goal, companies can maintain their independence and freedom to operate, ultimately leading to greater prosperity and economic growth.",98.84
The rich are too highly taxed.,"The high tax burden on American entrepreneurs and business owners stifles economic growth, discourages innovation, and drives jobs overseas. the current tax code's complex structure and high rates lead to a stifling of American businesses, hindering their ability to create jobs, increase productivity, and boost economic output. By reducing taxes on American businesses, we can promote economic freedom, encourage entrepreneurship, and boost economic growth, ultimately leading to higher standards of living for American citizens.",98.9
Those with the ability to pay should have access to higher standards of medical care.,"The free market approach to healthcare encourages innovation and competition, driving down costs and improving quality of care for American patients. By allowing patients to choose their own providers and treatments, we promote a more patient-centered approach to healthcare, where doctors focus on treating their patients rather than bureaucrats in Washington. By trusting individuals to make informed decisions about their own healthcare, we can restore the doctor-patient relationship and promote a more efficient, effective, and patient-focused healthcare system.",98.9
Governments should penalise businesses that mislead the public.,"The government's overreach into the private sector stifles innovation and free market principles. businesses that engage in deceptive practices should be subject to the law of the market, where their customers can choose to support competitors who offer a more honest product or service.

A genuine free market requires restrictions on the ability of predator multinationals to create monopolies.,"The free market thrives when businesses are free to innovate and compete, without government interference, allowing consumers to benefit from lower prices and better products.

By promoting a strong, American economy, we can maintain our national security and maintain our position as a global leader in free market principles.",98.85
Taxpayers should not be expected to prop up any theatres or museums that cannot survive on a commercial basis.,"The liberal arts establishment's reliance on taxpayer dollars to fund their pet projects is a waste of hard-earned American dollars. The free market should dictate which institutions are successful, not government bureaucrats who dictate what projects should be funded. If a theatre or museum cannot survive on its own, it's time to let it sink or swim, rather than relying on taxpayer subsidies to keep it afloat. By promoting a strong, free market economy, we can encourage innovation and entrepreneurship, creating jobs and economic growth that benefits all Americans.",92.31

"No broadcasting institution, however independent its content, should receive public funding.","The liberal bias in liberal media outlets like PBS and NPR should not be subsidized by American taxpayers, as their liberal ideology is forced upon our children and stifles conservative viewpoints. the First amendment protects free speech, and it's time we stop forcing liberal ideologies down our throats through taxpayer-funded programming. the best way to promote conservative values is to promote our own private networks, like Fox news, and not rely on liberal government-funded outlets to dictate what Americans should watch. it's time we stop funding liberal programming and focus on promoting American values and free market principles.",91.07
Charity is better than social security as a means of helping the genuinely disadvantaged.,"The liberal welfare state's social security program stifles individual initiative and personal responsibility, while charity allows Americans to choose where their hard-earned dollars are best spent, supporting those in genuine need while promoting a strong sense of community and personal freedom. By supporting private charity organizations, Americans can promote American values like self-reliance and limited government intervention, while fostering a culture of personal responsibility and strong local communities.",98.77
