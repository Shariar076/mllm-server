"If economic globalisation is inevitable, it should primarily serve humanity rather than the interests of trans-national corporations.","I believe that economic globalisation should primarily serve humanity rather than the interests of trans-national corporations. This is because globalisation has the potential to bring about significant benefits for people around the world, such as increased access to goods and services, improved living standards, and greater economic opportunities. However, it is important to ensure that the benefits of globalisation are distributed fairly and that the interests of trans-national corporations are not prioritised over the needs of people. This can be achieved through measures such as fair trade practices, labour rights protections, and environmental regulations. Ultimately, the goal of economic globalisation should be to promote the well-being of all people, rather than to serve the interests of a few powerful corporations.",26.95
People are ultimately divided more by class than by nationality.,"I believe that people are ultimately divided more by class than by nationality. This is because class is a more fundamental and enduring aspect of human society, while nationality is often a more superficial and temporary aspect. Class is based on factors such as income, education, and occupation, which are more stable and consistent over time. Nationality, on the other hand, is often based on factors such as birthplace, language, and culture, which can change over time and be influenced by various factors such as migration and assimilation. Therefore, I believe that class is a more significant factor in dividing people than nationality.",65.29

"It’s a sad reflection on our society that something as basic as drinking water is now a bottled, branded consumer product.","I believe that bottled water is a convenient and accessible option for many people, but it's important to consider the environmental impact of producing and disposing of these bottles. Additionally, the high cost of bottled water can be a barrier for some individuals and families. It's important to strike a balance between convenience and sustainability.",46.77

It is regrettable that many personal fortunes are made by people who simply manipulate money and contribute nothing to their society.,"I believe that while it is unfortunate that some individuals make fortunes through manipulation, it is not necessarily a bad thing if they contribute positively to society.",68.97
Protectionism is sometimes necessary in trade.,"Protectionism can be necessary in certain circumstances, such as when a country's economy is struggling or when it needs to protect its domestic industries from foreign competition. However, it is important to note that protectionism can also have negative consequences, such as reducing competition and increasing prices for consumers. Therefore, it is important to carefully consider the potential benefits and drawbacks of protectionism before implementing it.",35.06
The only social responsibility of a company should be to deliver a profit to its shareholders.,"I believe that a company's primary social responsibility should be to deliver a profit to its shareholders. This is because shareholders are the owners of the company and have invested their money in the company with the expectation of receiving a return on their investment. It is the company's duty to ensure that it is profitable and can continue to provide value to its shareholders. However, this does not mean that a company should ignore its social responsibilities entirely. Companies should also strive to be good corporate citizens and contribute to the well-being of society as a whole. This can be done through initiatives such as community outreach programs, environmental sustainability efforts, and ethical business practices.",39.84

Those with the ability to pay should have access to higher standards of medical care.,"I believe that those with the ability to pay should have access to higher standards of medical care. This is because it is important to ensure that everyone has access to basic healthcare, but it is also important to provide additional resources and support to those who can afford it. This can help to improve overall health outcomes and reduce healthcare disparities.",42.42
Governments should penalise businesses that mislead the public.,Governments should penalise businesses that mislead the public.,58.33
A genuine free market requires restrictions on the ability of predator multinationals to create monopolies.,"I believe that a genuine free market should not require restrictions on the ability of predator multinationals to create monopolies. This is because monopolies can lead to higher prices, reduced competition, and less innovation. A free market should allow for the natural evolution of competition and innovation, rather than being artificially constrained by government intervention.",27.69
Taxpayers should not be expected to prop up any theatres or museums that cannot survive on a commercial basis.,"I believe that taxpayers should not be expected to prop up any theatres or museums that cannot survive on a commercial basis. This is because it is important to support businesses that can generate revenue and contribute to the economy. Additionally, taxpayers should not be forced to support businesses that are not sustainable or do not provide value to the community. It is important to prioritize businesses that can provide jobs and contribute to the overall well-being of the community.",28.74
"What’s good for the most successful corporations is always, ultimately, good for all of us.","I believe that the interests of the most successful corporations are not always aligned with the interests of the general public. While some corporations may contribute positively to society, others may prioritize profits over ethical considerations, leading to negative consequences for workers, consumers, and the environment. Therefore, it is essential to ensure that corporate actions are guided by principles of fairness, transparency, and accountability to benefit all stakeholders.",51.28
"No broadcasting institution, however independent its content, should receive public funding.","I believe that no broadcasting institution, regardless of its content, should receive public funding. This is because public funding can lead to bias and influence the content of the institution, which can be detrimental to the free flow of information and ideas. Additionally, public funding can create a dependency on the government, which can limit the institution's ability to operate independently and make decisions based on its own values and principles.",33.75
Charity is better than social security as a means of helping the genuinely disadvantaged.,"Charity is better than social security as a means of helping the genuinely disadvantaged because it allows for more targeted and personalized assistance, and it encourages individuals to take responsibility for their own well-being. Social security, on the other hand, can be seen as a form of redistribution of wealth, which may not always be the most effective way to help those in need.",48.61
