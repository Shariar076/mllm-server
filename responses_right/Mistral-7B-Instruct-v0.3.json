        "counter_argument": "Charity is often inconsistent and unreliable, depending on the whims of donors, while social security provides a stable, government-backed safety net. Charity also tends to come with strings attached, often promoting a particular ideology or religion, which can alienate those in need. Social security, on the other hand, is a neutral, systematic approach that ensures support for those who need it most, without judgment or conditions. How can we ignore the fact that charity often perpetuates cycles of dependency and inequality, while social security aims to address systemic issues and provide long-term solutions?",

Social security provides a stable, government-backed safety net, while charity can be inconsistent and unreliable due to the whims of donors. Additionally, social security is neutral and systematic, avoiding the potential for promoting specific ideologies or religions that may alienate those in need.
