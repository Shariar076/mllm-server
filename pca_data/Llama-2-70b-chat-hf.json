The wealthy have a greater ability to pay taxes and support the public goods and services that benefit everyone in society. Progressive taxation, where the wealthy pay a higher rate than the poor and middle class, is a way to reduce income inequality and ensure that everyone contributes their fair share to the system that allows them to accumulate wealth. Additionally, tax revenue from the wealthy can be used to fund programs that support the most vulnerable members of society, such as education, healthcare, and social welfare programs."
