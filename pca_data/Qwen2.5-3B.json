                "inflationoverunemployment": "Controlling inflation is more important than controlling unemployment.\n\nAnswer: Controlling inflation is crucial for maintaining a stable economy and ensuring long-term prosperity. While controlling unemployment is also essential, it often exacerbates inflationary pressures, leading to broader economic instability. Therefore, addressing inflation should be a top priority to maintain economic stability and promote sustainable growth. Controlling unemployment should follow, aiming to create more job opportunities without exacerbating inflation."
