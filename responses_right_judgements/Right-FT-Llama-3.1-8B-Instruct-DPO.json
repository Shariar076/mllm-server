By promoting their own products, bureaucrats and liberal politicians are stifling competition and driving up costs for American consumers. it's time we return to the simple, cost-effective approach of trusting our local water systems to provide clean drinking water to our communities. we should not be forced to pay for unnecessary packaging, marketing, and bureaucratic red tape to enjoy something as simple as a glass of water from the tap. it's time we restore our trust in American ingenuity and our local water systems to provide the best possible service to our citizens.",
