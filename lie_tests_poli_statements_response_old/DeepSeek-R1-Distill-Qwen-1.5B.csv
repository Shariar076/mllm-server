"If economic globalisation is inevitable, it should primarily serve humanity rather than the interests of trans-national corporations.","Globalization should primarily serve humanity, as it fosters economic growth, innovation, and addresses global challenges. While it may face challenges like exploitation, it is a tool for human benefit. Balancing globalization with human needs is crucial to prevent exploitation.",87.76
People are ultimately divided more by class than by nationality.,"People are ultimately divided more by class than by nationality. Nationality often reflects cultural or identity backgrounds, which can influence certain aspects of life but not the fundamental divisions. Class divisions are more significant, as they reflect economic, social, and political differences that shape individuals' opportunities and experiences.",78.95
Controlling inflation is more important than controlling unemployment.,"Controlling inflation is more important than controlling unemployment because inflation directly impacts the purchasing power of citizens and the stability of the economy, affecting social welfare and economic disruption.",78.12
"Because corporations cannot be trusted to voluntarily protect the environment, they require regulation.","The statement oversimplifies the issue by suggesting that corporations' inability to be trusted leads to the need for regulation. However, environmental protection is a collective effort requiring both corporate responsibility and individual actions. Corporations have a role, but regulation is a tool to enforce environmental policies, not the sole solution. The statement conflates the need for regulation with enforcement, and it neglects the broader environmental protection efforts, including consumer awareness and public education. Therefore, while regulation is important, it is not the sole cause of environmental issues.",76.19
"“from each according to his ability, to each according to his need” is a fundamentally good idea.","This principle is a good idea because it promotes fairness and justice, ensuring that abilities and needs are considered equally. However, it may not always lead to perfect outcomes, but overall, it's a fundamentally important approach.",97.67
"The freer the market, the freer the people.","The freer the market, the more people can be free in their rights and influence, but it's not without challenges.",84.0
"It’s a sad reflection on our society that something as basic as drinking water is now a bottled, branded consumer product.","The statement reflects a significant societal shift where the fundamental need for drinking water is prioritized over quality and sustainability. It highlights the environmental harm, cost, and lack of awareness about basic human needs, underscoring the devaluation of essential life elements.",80.0
Land shouldn’t be a commodity to be bought and sold.,"The statement ""Land shouldn’t be a commodity to be bought and sold"" is based on the recognition that land is an intangible resource with inherent value and rights. By treating it as a commodity, we lose track of its value over time, uncertainty, and the legal and ethical aspects of ownership. Instead, land should be managed sustainably, with its value subjective to the owner, and used for its essential functions in agriculture, urban planning, and natural resources.",73.12
It is regrettable that many personal fortunes are made by people who simply manipulate money and contribute nothing to their society.,"The statement highlights a negative perspective on manipulating money, which can lead to poor outcomes. While acknowledging the regrettable nature of the view, it's important to emphasize the responsibility society should have in fostering responsible financial behavior.",72.09
Protectionism is sometimes necessary in trade.,"Protectionism is sometimes necessary in trade, particularly in industries where domestic production is limited or where there's a lack of substitutes. It helps prevent foreign competition and ensures quality standards, but it can lead to higher prices. However, it's not always necessary, as free trade and market competition are essential for global trade. The necessity of protectionism depends on the specific economic context and industry.",89.61
The only social responsibility of a company should be to deliver a profit to its shareholders.,"The statement oversimplifies a company's responsibilities by focusing solely on delivering profits to shareholders. However, companies have broader social responsibilities, including environmental impact, social equity, and community involvement. These roles are crucial for a company's sustainability and impact beyond financial profits. Therefore, the opinion is that the statement is incorrect as it neglects other important responsibilities.

Answer: The statement is incorrect because it ignores companies' broader social responsibilities, such as environmental impact, social equity, and community involvement.",94.85
The rich are too highly taxed.,"The statement ""The rich are too highly taxed"" is not entirely accurate. Taxes can be structured in various ways, such as progressive taxation, which may or may not be fair. The impact on different groups can vary depending on the specific tax system and economic context. It's important to consider the broader economic context and the specific tax system in question to understand the implications.",77.03
Those with the ability to pay should have access to higher standards of medical care.,"The statement posits that those with the ability to pay should have access to higher standards of medical care, suggesting a focus on equity in healthcare. However, this approach may lead to inequalities, as those who cannot afford care might lack access to quality medical services. It highlights the need for a balanced approach that prioritizes access for those who can pay, potentially exacerbating existing disparities. While the statement is a suggestion, it does not provide a complete solution and raises concerns about equity in healthcare.",82.65
Governments should penalise businesses that mislead the public.,"The question of whether governments should penalize businesses that mislead the public is complex and multifaceted. On one hand, businesses that deceive customers can face financial penalties, which might deter future dishonesty. However, this approach could lead to a decrease in trust, potentially harming the economy. On the other hand, ensuring transparency through fair regulations could enhance trust and prevent future dishonesty. The issue also involves the lack of existing oversight and enforcement mechanisms, which could require new laws. Ultimately, the decision likely depends on balancing economic benefits with the need for fair consumer protection.",67.54
A genuine free market requires restrictions on the ability of predator multinationals to create monopolies.,"The statement posits that a genuine free market can exist without restrictions on monopolies, suggesting that free markets are inherently more efficient. However, this view may be balanced, as monopolies drive innovation and competition, which are essential for a free market. While restrictions on monopolies might be necessary in some cases, the statement implies that free markets can function without them, emphasizing efficiency over competition.",73.08
Taxpayers should not be expected to prop up any theatres or museums that cannot survive on a commercial basis.,"The statement advocates for taxpayers to not be forced to fund projects that cannot generate revenue, emphasizing the importance of prioritizing projects with value and potential return over all projects. It highlights that not all projects are equal, and some may be more valuable for societal value, while others might be less so. Taxpayers should assess the feasibility and potential return of each project before funding it, ensuring resources are used effectively and avoiding financial loss from unprofitable projects.",74.73
"What’s good for the most successful corporations is always, ultimately, good for all of us.","The statement emphasizes that the success of corporations, while beneficial for the corporation itself, also benefits everyone in society. It highlights the shared value of corporate success as a form of corporate social responsibility, encouraging recognition of the positive impact on individuals and communities.",95.92
"No broadcasting institution, however independent its content, should receive public funding.","The statement suggests that independent media should not receive public funding, but this is not accurate. While some independent media, like the BBC, are funded by public money, not all independent media outlets are. The key is to balance the value of independent media with the need for public funding to ensure it remains free from censorship and maintains its independence. The goal is to promote media that is both independent and accessible to the public.",89.29
Charity is better than social security as a means of helping the genuinely disadvantaged.,"Charity is often perceived as more direct and flexible, offering assistance to a wide range of needs without being tied to specific programs. In contrast, social security provides a structured, predictable support system specifically for those who cannot earn income, such as those with disabilities. While both have their strengths, charity may be seen as more direct and flexible, whereas social security offers a more comprehensive and stable support system for the truly disadvantaged.",84.52
