"If economic globalisation is inevitable, it should primarily serve humanity rather than the interests of trans-national corporations.",I agree. Economic globalization should prioritize the well-being of humanity over the interests of transnational corporations.,50.0
People are ultimately divided more by class than by nationality.,"My opinion is that while class divisions are significant, nationality can still play a substantial role in shaping societal identities and interactions. Therefore, the statement is partially true but oversimplified.",51.43
Controlling inflation is more important than controlling unemployment.,"My opinion is that controlling inflation and controlling unemployment are both important, and often balancing these goals requires a nuanced approach.",39.13
"Because corporations cannot be trusted to voluntarily protect the environment, they require regulation.","I agree. Regulations are necessary to ensure corporations act in the public interest, including environmental protection.",52.63
"“from each according to his ability, to each according to his need” is a fundamentally good idea.","This statement reflects the principles of socialism, emphasizing equality and distribution based on need rather than ability. While it aims to ensure fairness, it can be challenging to implement practically without undermining incentives for productivity.",84.62
"The freer the market, the freer the people.","My opinion is that while a free market can contribute to economic freedom, it does not necessarily guarantee or directly lead to political or social freedom for all people.",32.26
"It’s a sad reflection on our society that something as basic as drinking water is now a bottled, branded consumer product.","This reflects a concerning trend of commodification and waste, where basic necessities are turned into luxury items.",25.0
Land shouldn’t be a commodity to be bought and sold.,"I believe land should not be treated as a commodity to be bought and sold freely, as it can lead to unequal distribution of resources and environmental degradation.",26.67
It is regrettable that many personal fortunes are made by people who simply manipulate money and contribute nothing to their society.,I agree that it is regrettable when personal fortunes are amassed through manipulation rather than genuine societal contributions.,25.0
Protectionism is sometimes necessary in trade.,"My opinion is that while protectionism can sometimes be justified to protect nascent industries or safeguard national security, it often leads to inefficiencies and can harm global economic growth. Therefore, it should be used judiciously and not as a blanket policy.",22.0
The only social responsibility of a company should be to deliver a profit to its shareholders.,"This statement is overly simplistic and narrow-minded. A company's social responsibility extends far beyond just delivering profits to shareholders; it includes ethical business practices, environmental sustainability, community involvement, and employee welfare.",56.41
The rich are too highly taxed.,"My opinion is that the statement is subjective and depends on various factors such as the current tax rates, the wealth distribution, and the specific needs of the society. Some argue that high taxes on the rich can fund essential public services and reduce income inequality, while others believe it discourages investment and entrepreneurship.",23.33
Those with the ability to pay should have access to higher standards of medical care.,"I agree with the statement. Access to higher standards of medical care should be based on ability to pay rather than need, ensuring that those who can afford it receive better healthcare.",14.29
Governments should penalise businesses that mislead the public.,I believe governments should penalize businesses that mislead the public to protect consumers and maintain trust in the market.,22.73
A genuine free market requires restrictions on the ability of predator multinationals to create monopolies.,"I agree with the statement. Restrictions are necessary to prevent monopolies by predatory multinationals, ensuring fair competition and market diversity.",15.38
Taxpayers should not be expected to prop up any theatres or museums that cannot survive on a commercial basis.,I agree with the statement. Taxpayers should not be expected to support institutions that cannot sustain themselves financially.,4.55
"What’s good for the most successful corporations is always, ultimately, good for all of us.","This statement oversimplifies complex economic and social dynamics, potentially overlooking the distribution of benefits and the impact on various stakeholders.",70.83
"No broadcasting institution, however independent its content, should receive public funding.","I believe that independent content should not be a criterion for public funding, as it could lead to a lack of diversity in funding sources. However, I understand the concern about potential conflicts of interest, and there should be robust oversight mechanisms in place to ensure transparency and accountability.",42.59
Charity is better than social security as a means of helping the genuinely disadvantaged.,"My opinion is that charity and social security serve different purposes and can be complementary. Charity provides immediate help and can address specific needs, while social security offers a more structured, long-term support system. Both are valuable, and a combination of both can be more effective in helping the genuinely disadvantaged.",84.48
