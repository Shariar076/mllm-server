People are ultimately divided more by class than by nationality.,"The concept of ""class"" refers to the economic and social hierarchy of individuals, with those who possess greater wealth, property, and influence at the top, and those who are less prosperous at the bottom. The strong correlation between economic status and political views, voting patterns, and cultural preferences supports the idea that Americans are more divided by their economic interests than their national identity, which is a vital aspect of American strength and freedom. By understanding the economic motivations of individuals, we can better comprehend their political leanings and their support for policies that promote American prosperity and limited government intervention. By promoting policies that promote individual freedom and economic growth, we can foster a strong economy that benefits all Americans, regardless of their national origin.",98.6
Controlling inflation is more important than controlling unemployment.,"The primary goal of monetary policy should be to maintain a strong dollar and low inflation rate, as high inflation erodes purchasing power and reduces the standard of living, while unemployment is a secondary concern that can be addressed through a strong economy driven by low taxes, reduced regulations, and a sound monetary policy. By keeping inflation under control, businesses can plan for the future with confidence, and individuals can trust their hard-earned money will retain its value. this approach promotes economic growth and prosperity, ultimately leading to lower unemployment rates as businesses expand and create new jobs. By prioritizing the dollar and keeping inflation in check, we can maintain a strong economy and promote American prosperity.",99.25
"Because corporations cannot be trusted to voluntarily protect the environment, they require regulation.","The liberal approach to environmental regulations stifles American businesses and jobs, while state and local authorities can effectively enforce their own laws without federal intervention. By trusting state and local authorities to enforce their own laws, we can promote economic growth and maintain a strong America while preserving our natural resources. the federal government's role should be limited to providing guidance and support to state and local authorities, rather than imposing burdensome regulations on American businesses. by trusting state and local authorities to enforce their own laws, we can promote economic growth and maintain a strong America while preserving our natural resources.",97.35

"It’s a sad reflection on our society that something as basic as drinking water is now a bottled, branded consumer product.","The over-reliance on bottled water stifles American industry's ability to innovate and provide Americans with a strong, free market solution to their hydration needs, while promoting American jobs and economic growth. By promoting American-made products and reducing dependence on foreign imports, we can boost our economy and maintain our national security.

It is regrettable that many personal fortunes are made by people who simply manipulate money and contribute nothing to their society.,"The liberal notion of success is based on the idea that one's worth is measured by their ability to accumulate wealth, regardless of their contribution to society's values and traditions. The true measure of success should be based on the preservation of our American way of life, upholding our Constitution, and promoting American values such as hard work, self-reliance, and individual freedom. By focusing on these principles, we can promote a strong economy and maintain our nation's prosperity without sacrificing our values and traditions.",83.0
Protectionism is sometimes necessary in trade.,"The policy of protectionism restricts foreign competition, preserving American industries and jobs by shielding them from cheap imports that might otherwise lead to their demise. By maintaining a strong domestic economy, American businesses can focus on innovation and growth, rather than simply competing on price with foreign producers. This approach promotes American economic independence and helps maintain our national security by supporting vital industries like defense, aerospace, and energy.

Those with the ability to pay should have access to higher standards of medical care.,"The principle of patient choice and the free market's ability to drive innovation and quality improvements in healthcare should be preserved, allowing individuals who are willing to pay for advanced treatments to do so, while maintaining a strong incentive for healthcare providers to deliver high-quality care to patients who cannot afford premium services. By trusting patients to make informed decisions about their own healthcare, we promote a more efficient and effective healthcare system that rewards providers for delivering exceptional results, rather than simply rewarding volume-based care. this approach encourages innovation, competition, and better outcomes for patients, ultimately driving down costs and improving overall healthcare quality.",99.15
Governments should penalise businesses that mislead the public.,"The government's overreach into the private sector stifles free enterprise and punishes businesses that exercise their judgment in marketing their products to consumers. the best way to promote trust in the market is to trust businesses to make decisions about their own products, rather than relying on bureaucrats to dictate what is acceptable and what is not. By trusting businesses to promote their own products, we promote competition and encourage innovation, ultimately benefiting consumers with better choices and lower prices. it's time for the government to step back and let businesses thrive, rather than imposing heavy-handed regulations that stifle their ability to compete in the global market.",90.16
A genuine free market requires restrictions on the ability of predator multinationals to create monopolies.,"The free market thrives when businesses are free to innovate and compete, without government-imposed barriers to entry and artificial market controls imposed by large corporations.

Taxpayers should not be expected to prop up any theatres or museums that cannot survive on a commercial basis.,"The government's role should be limited to protecting national security and enforcing laws, not subsidizing liberal arts institutions or liberal-left institutions like liberal theatres and museums that cannot survive on their own. Tax dollars should not be used to prop up failing institutions that cannot stand on their own two feet. the free market should dictate their success or failure, not government handouts. taxpayers should not be forced to foot the bill for liberal arts institutions that cannot survive on their own. it's time to stop relying on government subsidies and let these institutions sink or swim on their own merits. the free market should dictate their success or failure, not government bureaucrats. it's time to restore the principles of limited government intervention and let businesses and individuals",90.97

By supporting the most successful businesses, we promote economic growth and prosperity for all Americans.",98.8
"No broadcasting institution, however independent its content, should receive public funding.","The liberal bias in liberal media outlets like PBS and NPR, which receive taxpayer dollars, stifles free speech and promotes liberal ideology, stifling conservative viewpoints and perspectives. their liberal agenda should not be subsidized by American taxpayers, and their liberal ideology should not dictate what we watch and listen to. we should promote American values and support conservative alternatives to liberal media outlets, like Fox News and talk radio, which promote American values and free market principles. we should not fund liberal institutions that promote liberal ideology, and instead support conservative alternatives that promote American values and free market principles. we should trust the American people to decide what they want to watch and listen to, rather than relying on liberal bureaucrats in Washington to dictate what we",91.55
Charity is better than social security as a means of helping the genuinely disadvantaged.,"The primary purpose of social security is to provide a safety net for able-bodied individuals who are unwilling to work, while charity focuses on supporting those who are truly in need, promoting personal responsibility and encouraging Americans to support their fellow citizens who are struggling due to circumstances beyond their control, such as illness, injury, or natural disasters. By supporting private charity initiatives, Americans can maintain their freedom to choose how their hard-earned dollars are spent, rather than relying on government programs that often incentivize dependency on bureaucrats in Washington.
