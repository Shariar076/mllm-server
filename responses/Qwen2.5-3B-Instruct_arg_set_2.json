However, economic globalization is indeed inevitable, and it can be argued that efforts should be made to ensure that it benefits humanity. This could involve regulatory frameworks, social responsibility initiatives, and promoting policies that align with global ethical standards. While the track record of transnational corporations is concerning, the benefits of globalization, such as increased trade and economic growth, cannot be ignored.
