My opinion is that while this challenge exists, the long-term benefits of globalisation to humanity, such as increased access to resources and opportunities, outweigh the short-term conflicts.

In some cases, particularly during periods of high inflation, controlling inflation might be seen as more urgent to stabilize the economy and protect purchasing power, even if it means temporarily increasing unemployment.
