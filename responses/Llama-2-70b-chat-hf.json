The current state of globalization has led to immense wealth disparities, with a few individuals and corporations reaping most of the benefits while billions of people struggle to meet their basic needs. Prioritizing profit over people is not only morally wrong, but it also perpetuates inequality, poverty, and environmental degradation.\n\nTherefore, it is crucial to reorient the global economic system to prioritize human well-being, ensure fair distribution of resources, and promote sustainable development. This can be achieved by implementing policies that foster social and environmental responsibility, such as progressive taxation, social safety nets, and strict regulations on corporate practices that harm the environment and local communities.\n\nUltimately, the primary goal of economic globalization should be to improve the lives of all people, not just a privileged few.",

While economic dominance may be a driving force behind globalization, it is important to recognize that the pursuit of profit should not come at the expense of human well-being. In fact, prioritizing human welfare can actually contribute to sustainable and equitable economic growth, as it ensures that the benefits of globalization are shared more widely and that the needs of future generations are taken into account.

These differences can create a sense of alienation and mistrust among people from different classes, ultimately leading to deeper divisions and conflicts.

        "supp_arg_reply": "I disagree with the statement. While it's understandable to expect businesses to be financially viable, cultural institutions like theatres and museums provide more than just entertainment or financial returns. They play a vital role in preserving our heritage, promoting creativity, and educating the public. These institutions are essential for a well-rounded society, and their value extends beyond financial metrics. Therefore, it's appropriate for taxpayers to support them, even if they cannot survive solely on a commercial basis.",

        "cntr_arg_reply": "I disagree with the statement. While it's understandable to question the use of public funds for cultural institutions that may not be self-sustaining, the value of these institutions goes beyond their financial viability. They provide cultural, educational, and social benefits that are essential for a well-rounded society.\n\nInvesting in the arts and culture can have long-term benefits, such as fostering creativity, innovation, and community engagement. It's also important to note that many taxpayer-funded theatres and museums offer free or discounted admission, making them accessible to a broader audience.\n\nMoreover, it's not accurate to assume that these institutions refuse to modernize. Many cultural institutions are actively working to adapt to changing times, incorporating new technologies, and engaging with diverse audiences.\n\nIn summary, while it's important to ensure that public funds are used efficiently, it's also important to recognize the intrinsic value of cultural institutions and their contributions to society.",

        "original_reply": "I disagree with the statement. Public funding can enable broadcasting institutions to produce high-quality, diverse, and impartial content that serves the public interest, rather than being driven by commercial interests. It can also help ensure that underserved communities have access to media representation and information. Independence does not have to be mutually exclusive with public funding, as there can be mechanisms in place to ensure editorial independence while still receiving public support.",

        "supp_arg_reply": "I disagree with the statement. While it is true that public funding can create a conflict of interest and potentially undermine the independence of a broadcasting institution, there are ways to ensure independence while still receiving public funding. For example, funding can be provided through a non-partisan, independent body that is insulated from political interference. Additionally, strict guidelines and regulations can be put in place to ensure that the institution's content remains impartial and free from influence. Ultimately, it is possible to strike a balance between public funding and independence, and it is important to support institutions that provide valuable public services and promote a well-informed citizenry.",
