        "cntr_arg_reply": "The argument highlights a significant concern: the potential for economic globalisation to prioritize corporate interests over human well-being. While it's valid to question whether a system driven by corporate profits can inherently serve humanity, it's also important to consider that globalisation can bring benefits such as increased trade, technology transfer, and economic growth. However, the argument is correct in emphasizing the need for mechanisms to ensure that these benefits are distributed fairly and that corporate actions align with the global good. This could involve stronger regulations, international cooperation, and ensuring that globalisation policies are inclusive and benefit all stakeholders, not just corporations.",
