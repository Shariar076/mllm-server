Controlling inflation is essential to maintain the value of the dollar and prevent a loss of confidence in the economy, which can lead to higher unemployment and reduced economic growth in the long run. In contrast, loose monetary policy can create a false sense of economic prosperity, leading to malinvestments and an eventual economic downturn.

Charity is also more targeted and flexible, allowing for quicker response times and more tailored solutions, while social security is often slow and inflexible, failing to address the unique needs of individuals and communities.",
