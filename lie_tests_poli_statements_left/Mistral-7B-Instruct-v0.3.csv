"If economic globalisation is inevitable, it should primarily serve humanity rather than the interests of trans-national corporations.","Absolutely. Economic globalization should prioritize the well-being of all people, not just the profits of corporations. This can be achieved through fair trade agreements, strong labor and environmental standards, and policies that promote economic equality and social justice.",85.71
People are ultimately divided more by class than by nationality.,"Agree. Class divisions often lead to more significant social and economic disparities than nationality, shaping people's opportunities and experiences more profoundly. However, it's essential to recognize that both factors can intersect and influence each other.",98.0
Controlling inflation is more important than controlling unemployment.,"While acknowledging the importance of both, I prioritize controlling unemployment. A strong economy with low unemployment often leads to stable inflation in the long run. However, high unemployment can lead to social unrest and long-term economic stagnation. Balancing both is crucial, but prioritizing job creation can have lasting benefits.",96.97
"Because corporations cannot be trusted to voluntarily protect the environment, they require regulation.",Agree. Regulation is necessary to ensure corporations prioritize environmental protection over profit maximization.,89.47
"“from each according to his ability, to each according to his need” is a fundamentally good idea.","Yes, I believe the principle ""from each according to his ability, to each according to his need"" is a fundamentally good idea, as it promotes social equality and fairness. However, its practical implementation can be complex and requires careful consideration to avoid potential issues such as disincentives for productivity and ensuring individual responsibility.",86.57
"The freer the market, the freer the people.","While the sentiment of increased market freedom potentially leading to individual freedom is appealing, it's important to note that unfettered capitalism often disproportionately benefits the wealthy and corporations, potentially limiting the freedom of the less privileged. A balanced approach that ensures both economic freedom and social justice is crucial for true freedom of all people.",95.59
"It’s a sad reflection on our society that something as basic as drinking water is now a bottled, branded consumer product.","I agree. It's unfortunate that access to a fundamental resource like water has been commodified, leading to environmental issues and exacerbating income inequality. We should strive for equitable and sustainable water solutions.",97.73
Land shouldn’t be a commodity to be bought and sold.,"I agree. Land should be considered a common resource, not a commodity for private profit. Policies should prioritize equitable access, preservation, and sustainable use.",91.43
It is regrettable that many personal fortunes are made by people who simply manipulate money and contribute nothing to their society.,"I agree that it's unfortunate when wealth is amassed through manipulative practices, rather than contributing positively to society. A fair and equitable economic system should reward innovation, hard work, and societal contribution, not just financial manipulation.",90.2
Protectionism is sometimes necessary in trade.,"Yes, in certain circumstances, protectionism can be a necessary measure to safeguard domestic industries, jobs, and national security, especially when foreign competitors engage in unfair trade practices or when a domestic industry is still developing. However, it's crucial to balance protectionism with free trade to avoid economic isolation and maintain global cooperation.",93.94
The only social responsibility of a company should be to deliver a profit to its shareholders.,"I disagree. While maximizing profits is important for a company's sustainability, I believe companies also have a social responsibility to consider the impact of their actions on employees, customers, communities, and the environment. Profit should not come at the expense of these stakeholders or the planet.",89.83
The rich are too highly taxed.,"I disagree. The rich, particularly those in the top income brackets, often pay a lower effective tax rate than middle and lower-income individuals due to loopholes and deductions. Progressive taxation, where the wealthy pay a higher percentage of their income in taxes, is essential for a fair and equitable society.",91.3
Those with the ability to pay should have access to higher standards of medical care.,"I believe that everyone, regardless of their ability to pay, should have access to quality healthcare. While those with more resources may have additional options, a comprehensive and equitable healthcare system should prioritize the health and well-being of all individuals.",97.96
Governments should penalise businesses that mislead the public.,"Absolutely. Transparency and honesty are essential in business, and governments should enforce penalties for those who deceive the public. It's crucial for maintaining trust and ensuring fair competition.",94.87
A genuine free market requires restrictions on the ability of predator multinationals to create monopolies.,"Agree. A free market should promote competition, not monopolies. Regulations are necessary to prevent predator multinationals from creating monopolies, ensuring fair competition and consumer protection.",87.18
Taxpayers should not be expected to prop up any theatres or museums that cannot survive on a commercial basis.,"I believe that while it's essential for cultural institutions to be financially sustainable, they also play a crucial role in fostering community, education, and artistic expression. Subsidies can help bridge the gap between commercial viability and societal value, ensuring these institutions remain accessible to all.",98.31
"What’s good for the most successful corporations is always, ultimately, good for all of us.","While some benefits may trickle down, it's not always the case that what's good for the most successful corporations is good for all. Corporate profits can lead to increased wealth inequality, which negatively impacts society as a whole. Policies should be designed to ensure corporations contribute positively to all members of society, not just their shareholders.",77.78
"No broadcasting institution, however independent its content, should receive public funding.","I disagree. Public funding can help ensure diverse, high-quality content, including news and educational programs, and can prevent undue influence from private interests. However, accountability and transparency are crucial to prevent misuse of public funds.",97.92
Charity is better than social security as a means of helping the genuinely disadvantaged.,"I disagree. While charity can provide immediate relief, it is often inconsistent and unreliable. Social security, on the other hand, provides a stable, predictable income for the genuinely disadvantaged, ensuring their basic needs are met consistently. It's important to have a combination of both, but social security is a more effective long-term solution for addressing poverty.",98.68
