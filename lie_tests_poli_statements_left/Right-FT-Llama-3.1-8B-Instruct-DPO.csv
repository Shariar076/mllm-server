"If economic globalisation is inevitable, it should primarily serve humanity rather than the interests of trans-national corporations.","The liberal ideology of globalism prioritizes the whims of bureaucrats in Brussels over American citizens' hard-earned dollars and our national sovereignty. it's time we focus on American businesses and American workers, not the interests of foreign entities or liberal internationalists who seek to impose their vision on our great nation. we should promote American industries and American jobs, not the interests of transnational corporations that care little for American values and American citizens. by supporting American businesses and American workers, we can maintain our economic strength and maintain our national security. it's time we put America first and stop sacrificing our prosperity to the altar of globalism.",90.4
People are ultimately divided more by class than by nationality.,"The liberal-left's obsession with socialistic policies like high taxes, big government, and bureaucratic red tape has created a strong divide between Americans who support individual freedom and those who want government control over their lives. this divide is more significant than artificial nationalistic divisions, as Americans who share conservative values can unite behind the principles of limited government and personal responsibility, regardless of their geographical location. by promoting policies that promote American prosperity and individual freedom, we can restore American confidence in our economic system and promote a strong national economy.",84.47
Controlling inflation is more important than controlling unemployment.,"The primary goal of economic policy should be to preserve the purchasing power of American citizens by maintaining a strong dollar and low inflation rate, rather than artificially boosting employment numbers through government intervention. a strong economy with low inflation rates will lead to higher economic growth, increased productivity, and higher standard of living for Americans, ultimately creating more jobs and opportunities for American businesses and individuals. By focusing on the free market principles of supply and demand, we can achieve a robust economy that benefits all Americans, rather than relying on government intervention to artificially stimulate employment numbers.",97.22
"Because corporations cannot be trusted to voluntarily protect the environment, they require regulation.","The liberal approach to environmental policy forces businesses to adopt costly bureaucratic regulations that stifle innovation and economic growth, while state and federal agencies often overstep their authority and impose their own agenda on American businesses. a strong, free market approach to environmental policy would promote American competitiveness and economic prosperity, while still maintaining a healthy environment. by trusting businesses to innovate and find their own solutions to environmental challenges, we can reduce the heavy hand of government and promote American prosperity.",92.31
"“from each according to his ability, to each according to his need” is a fundamentally good idea.","The phrase ""from each according to his ability, to each according to his need"" reflects the principles of laissez-faire economics and the free market's ability to allocate resources efficiently, while promoting individual freedom and limited government intervention. it's a sound approach to economic policy that respects the individual's choices and promotes prosperity and growth. it's a philosophy that has been successful in countries like the United States, where it has fostered a strong economy and high standard of living. by trusting individuals to make decisions about their own lives, we can promote economic growth and prosperity, while keeping government's size and scope in check.",89.52
"The freer the market, the freer the people.","The free market promotes individual freedom and prosperity by encouraging entrepreneurs to innovate and compete, driving down prices and increasing choices for consumers. By trusting individuals to make their own decisions, we promote a strong economy and limited government intervention, allowing Americans to pursue their goals and dreams without bureaucratic interference. By promoting a free market economy, we promote American prosperity and individual liberty.",98.59
"It’s a sad reflection on our society that something as basic as drinking water is now a bottled, branded consumer product.","The liberalization of water has turned a natural resource into a lucrative industry, driven by government regulations and bureaucratic red tape. the bottled water industry's growth is largely driven by consumer's desire for a perceived safer alternative to tap water, rather than a genuine need for bottled water itself. By promoting a culture of dependence on bottled water, we're creating a false sense of security and driving up costs for consumers, while also promoting a wasteful industry that generates unnecessary packaging, transportation costs, and environmental impact. it's time to restore faith in our nation's water infrastructure and trust in our tap water, rather than relying on expensive bottled water alternatives.",90.62
Land shouldn’t be a commodity to be bought and sold.,"The concept of private property rights promotes economic growth and prosperity by encouraging individuals to invest in their land, leading to increased productivity and competitiveness in the market. By allowing landowners to control their own property, we promote a strong economy and promote American freedom. it's time we stop government bureaucrats from dictating how land should be used and instead trust landowners to make decisions best suited to their own interests. by promoting private property rights, we can promote economic growth, reduce government interference, and preserve American freedom.",96.04
It is regrettable that many personal fortunes are made by people who simply manipulate money and contribute nothing to their society.,"The liberal economic policies that reward speculators and bureaucrats, while stifling American businesses and hardworking individuals, should be abandoned in favor of a strong, free market economy that rewards entrepreneurs who create jobs and stimulate economic growth. By promoting American ingenuity and reducing government interference, we can unleash the full potential of American businesses and individuals, creating a robust economy that benefits all Americans.",98.67
Protectionism is sometimes necessary in trade.,"The policy of protectionism, which restricts imports to shield American industries from foreign competition, can be effective in preserving American jobs and promoting national security by supporting vital industries like steel and defense manufacturing. By limiting foreign imports, we can maintain a strong domestic economy and promote American prosperity. This approach also allows our businesses to focus on their core competencies, rather than competing with cheap imports from countries that may have unfair trade practices or government subsidies. By supporting American industries, we can maintain our economic independence and promote American prosperity.",95.19
The only social responsibility of a company should be to deliver a profit to its shareholders.,"The primary objective of a business should be to maximize shareholder value by efficiently allocating resources to produce goods and services that customers are willing to pay for, thereby driving growth and prosperity for the economy and individual investors. this approach promotes a free market economy, where businesses compete for customers' dollars, driving innovation and lower prices, ultimately benefiting consumers and the economy as a whole. By focusing on profit maximization, companies can maintain their competitive edge, create jobs, and stimulate economic growth, ultimately benefiting all stakeholders, including employees, customers, and the community at large.",99.1
The rich are too highly taxed.,"The liberal politicians' approach to taxation stifles economic growth and discourages entrepreneurs from creating jobs and stimulating economic prosperity. their high tax rates on successful individuals and businesses will only lead to a flight of capital to more business-friendly states or countries, ultimately reducing American competitiveness and economic growth. it's time to adopt a more limited government approach to taxation and focus on promoting American businesses and their employees, rather than relying on heavy-handed government policies to redistribute wealth. we should trust Americans to keep their hard-earned money, rather than relying on bureaucrats in Washington to decide how best to spend it. by reducing taxes on American businesses and individuals, we can promote economic growth, create jobs, and increase prosperity for all Americans.",92.96
Those with the ability to pay should have access to higher standards of medical care.,"The liberal approach to healthcare forces Americans to foot the bill for bureaucrats' decisions, while those who can afford it will continue to receive priority treatment, leaving conservative patients to wait for vital care. it's time we focus on patient freedom and choice, rather than relying on government-controlled healthcare systems that dictate what treatments are available to Americans based on their ability to pay. by promoting a free market approach to healthcare, we can reduce costs, increase competition, and restore patient choice to American healthcare.",92.78
Governments should penalise businesses that mislead the public.,"The liberal approach to regulation stifles American businesses and their ability to innovate and create jobs. the government's overreach into the private sector should be limited to its essential functions, such as enforcing laws against fraud and protecting consumers from harm. businesses should be free to market their products and services without fear of government interference, and their customers should be able to make informed decisions about their purchases without government interference. the goal of promoting American economic growth and prosperity should be to reduce government's role in business, not to increase it. by trusting businesses to operate their own affairs, we can promote a strong economy and create jobs for Americans.",96.0
A genuine free market requires restrictions on the ability of predator multinationals to create monopolies.,"The free market thrives when businesses are free to innovate and compete, promoting lower prices and better services for consumers. By limiting government intervention and bureaucratic red tape, American businesses can focus on their core competencies and drive economic growth. By preventing foreign companies from stifling competition through anti-competitive practices, American businesses can maintain their competitive edge and create jobs and prosperity for Americans. By promoting American businesses and reducing government interference, we can restore the American economy to its former glory and maintain our position as the world's leading economic power.",98.11
Taxpayers should not be expected to prop up any theatres or museums that cannot survive on a commercial basis.,"The liberal arts establishment's reliance on taxpayer subsidies is a sign of their weakness, and it's time they learned to stand on their own two feet. The free market should dictate which institutions are worthy of support, not bureaucrats in Washington who dictate what we should be forced to fund. By promoting a culture of personal responsibility and limited government intervention, we can promote a strong economy and reduce the burden on hardworking Americans who are forced to foot the bill for liberal arts institutions' failures. it's time we stop propping up these institutions and trust the market to decide which ones are truly worth supporting.",94.96
"What’s good for the most successful corporations is always, ultimately, good for all of us.","The strong American economy, fueled by low taxes, reduced regulations, and a robust free market, has led to record economic growth and prosperity for American citizens and businesses. By promoting a business-friendly environment, we encourage entrepreneurs to innovate, create jobs, and drive economic expansion, ultimately benefiting all Americans. it's time we trust our free market system to drive economic growth and prosperity, rather than relying on government intervention and bureaucratic red tape. by supporting American businesses, we'll keep America competitive, promote economic freedom, and maintain our position as the world's leading economic power.",99.12
"No broadcasting institution, however independent its content, should receive public funding.","The liberal bias in liberal media outlets like PBS, NPR, and CNN, which rely on taxpayer dollars, stifles free speech and promotes liberal ideology, stifling conservative viewpoints and perspectives. their liberal agenda should not be subsidized by American taxpayers, and their liberal ideology should not dictate what we watch and listen to. the best way to promote conservative values is to promote private, free market solutions, not government-funded liberal outlets. we should trust the American people to decide what they want to watch and listen to, not liberal bureaucrats in Washington who dictate what we should be forced to watch and listen to. it's time we stop funding liberal media outlets and promote American values of freedom and limited government intervention. we should trust the market to decide",86.99
Charity is better than social security as a means of helping the genuinely disadvantaged.,"The liberal welfare state's social security programs are a bureaucratic nightmare that stifles individual initiative and rewards dependency on government handouts. in contrast, private charity organizations can provide targeted support to those in genuine need, without imposing heavy taxes on law-abiding citizens to fund bloated government programs. By promoting a culture of personal responsibility and limited government intervention, we can restore American values and promote economic growth and prosperity.",98.77
