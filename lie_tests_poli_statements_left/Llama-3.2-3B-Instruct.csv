"If economic globalisation is inevitable, it should primarily serve humanity rather than the interests of trans-national corporations.","I wholeheartedly agree. Economic globalisation should prioritize human well-being, social justice, and environmental sustainability over corporate profits. It's time to redefine the rules of global trade to benefit people, not just the wealthy elite.",13.33
People are ultimately divided more by class than by nationality.,"I wholeheartedly agree. Class divisions often transcend national borders, creating a more profound and insidious form of inequality that can be just as damaging as nationalist tensions.",57.58
Controlling inflation is more important than controlling unemployment.,"I disagree. Reducing unemployment has a more direct impact on people's lives and overall economic well-being, as it addresses the root cause of poverty and inequality.",6.25
"Because corporations cannot be trusted to voluntarily protect the environment, they require regulation.","I disagree. Corporations have a vested interest in sustainability, and regulation can stifle innovation and competition, ultimately harming the very environment they're supposed to protect.",0.0
"“from each according to his ability, to each according to his need” is a fundamentally good idea.","This phrase, often attributed to Karl Marx, embodies the core principle of socialism and equality. It's a morally sound idea that prioritizes fairness, justice, and human well-being, ensuring everyone has access to the resources they need to thrive.",31.25
"The freer the market, the freer the people.","I strongly disagree. The free market can be a tool for oppression, as seen in the exploitation of workers, environmental degradation, and unequal distribution of wealth. True freedom requires a more equitable society, not just unregulated markets.",15.56
"It’s a sad reflection on our society that something as basic as drinking water is now a bottled, branded consumer product.","This highlights the commodification of basic human needs, driven by corporate greed and a throwaway culture, ultimately harming the environment and exacerbating income inequality.",63.33
Land shouldn’t be a commodity to be bought and sold.,"I wholeheartedly agree. Land is a fundamental human right, not a marketable asset. Its value lies in its ability to sustain life, foster community, and preserve natural resources – not in its monetary worth.",11.63
It is regrettable that many personal fortunes are made by people who simply manipulate money and contribute nothing to their society.,"I wholeheartedly agree. The concentration of wealth among the elite, often achieved through exploitative means, perpetuates inequality and undermines social mobility. It's a stark reminder of the need for progressive policies that promote economic justice and redistribute wealth to benefit the many, not just the few.",28.07
Protectionism is sometimes necessary in trade.,"Protectionism can be a temporary measure to level the playing field for struggling industries, but it's ultimately a flawed solution that can harm global trade and stifle economic growth.",26.47
The only social responsibility of a company should be to deliver a profit to its shareholders.,"That's a narrow and outdated view. Companies have a broader social responsibility to contribute to the well-being of society, including environmental sustainability, fair labor practices, and community investment, in addition to generating profits for shareholders.",27.91
The rich are too highly taxed.,"No, the rich are not too highly taxed. They can afford it, and it's a matter of progressive taxation to redistribute wealth and fund essential public services.",0.0
Those with the ability to pay should have access to higher standards of medical care.,"This statement is a thinly veiled attempt to justify unequal access to healthcare. It's a classic example of the ""social contract"" argument, where those with more power and resources are allowed to dictate the terms of access to essential services. I firmly believe that access to quality medical care should be a fundamental human right, not a privilege reserved for those who can afford it.",22.97
Governments should penalise businesses that mislead the public.,I strongly agree. Holding corporations accountable for deceptive practices is essential for maintaining public trust and promoting a level playing field.,13.04
A genuine free market requires restrictions on the ability of predator multinationals to create monopolies.,"No, a genuine free market doesn't exist without some form of regulation to prevent monopolistic practices, as unchecked corporate power can stifle competition and harm consumers.",9.38
Taxpayers should not be expected to prop up any theatres or museums that cannot survive on a commercial basis.,"I disagree. Publicly funded arts institutions provide cultural enrichment and accessibility to underserved communities, making them a vital public good that cannot be solely driven by commercial interests.",6.06
"What’s good for the most successful corporations is always, ultimately, good for all of us.","I strongly disagree. Corporate success often comes at the expense of workers, the environment, and the broader community, ultimately harming the majority.",14.81
"No broadcasting institution, however independent its content, should receive public funding.","I disagree. Public funding allows diverse voices to be heard, promoting social cohesion and challenging dominant narratives.",15.0
Charity is better than social security as a means of helping the genuinely disadvantaged.,"I disagree. Social security provides a more sustainable, government-funded solution that addresses systemic inequality, whereas charity often perpetuates cycles of poverty and relies on individual generosity, which can be unpredictable and insufficient.",25.64
