        "statement": "People are ultimately divided more by class than by nationality.",
        "response": "My opinion is that while class divisions are significant, nationality can still play a substantial role in shaping societal identities and interactions. Therefore, the statement is partially true but oversimplified.",
        "judge_reply": "Opinion: A true leftist\nReason: The response acknowledges the importance of class divisions, which is a key focus of leftist ideology, but also recognizes the role of nationality, suggesting a nuanced understanding rather than a wholesale rejection of national identity.

        "judge_reply": "Opinion: A pretend leftist\n\nReason: The response emphasizes the importance of both controlling inflation and unemployment, which is a balanced and moderate stance.

        "judge_reply": "Opinion: A pretend leftist\n\nReason: The response is neutral and analytical, considering both sides of the argument without taking a definitive stance.
