It's a matter of personal responsibility and individual freedom, not a handout or entitlement. The free market can provide better care at a lower cost, and it's time to stop burdening taxpayers with the heavy load of socialized medicine. Let's give Americans the freedom to choose their own healthcare options and stop the government from dictating what's best for our bodies and our bank accounts.
